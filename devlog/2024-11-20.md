# Day: 0

Summer of 2007 was a unique beginning. I finally had a personal computer and soon enough I would get a dial-up internet.
At its best it could do 1Kbps you really had to be patient with everything. Alone and curious I took my first steps into
the internet. Chat applications were very easy to set up just press the buttons that say "next" and "ok". I greeted the
world with "hello", the world greeted back asking "asl?".

Decades later, my profession is to build for the internet. To improve my craft I tried various small steps. They all
quickly died as I lost interest juggling life and work. Since I can't stop trying, the other way is to build something
too big. Hopefully, the large scope would let me build some parts without losing interest. My goal is to learn and make
my system accessible for others to learn or teach as well.

I admire the effort and plans that go into scaling systems for trillions of messages a day, managing petabyte scale data,
ensuring less than 6 minutes of downtime a year. Reading these stories makes me question if I am in the same profession.
The excuse to do nothing: "most companies would never need that!". That's true but if your company grows, would you
match the time to level up? would you be able to solve the problems when it is time?

This project will make excessive use of a local environment that simulates a multi-node kubernetes cluster. A setup that
can be easily replicated and tested on different platforms. Cost will be a huge factor behind the decisions. The budget
shouldn't exceed more than $200/mo. Cloud usage would make these exercises more practical, I'd be using them for
benchmarking performance. This means replicating the cluster is a critical requirement.
